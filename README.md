### This is the week-5 learning tutorial from  
1. [Mackenzie's 12-in-12 challenge](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/)  
2. [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DR5JLZ2Qgg)  
3. [Github Repo](https://github.com/mackenziechild/movie_review)  

This week I built a Movie Review app  where signed in users can post ratings and reviews for the movies. Visitors can search their movies. Even partial matches work. A Movie also shows total number of reviews it has got and also the average user rating.

Additional libraries &  gems and resources used:  
1. [Devise: For authentication](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)  
2. [Paperclip Gem: For Image Uploading](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip)   
3. [Bootstrap-saas: For stylin](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass)  
4. [Searchkick: For Search Functionality](https://github.com/ankane/searchkick)
